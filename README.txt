Secret Santa Gift Exchange Web App
==============================================

This is a small project that can help you in the following use case

1.  You are having friends or families over for Christmas or some event
2.  Everyone is required to bring a present that will be given to a random person

XChange is a web application that makes users register to be a secret santa and the system will tell you the gift number you should write on your gift wrap.

Once everyone has registered their present and an optional message, you are ready to start!

XChange provides an interface where a person can click on a random gift box allocated to them and it will reveal the gift number of the gift they should receive.  It will also display the message the secret santa has left.
